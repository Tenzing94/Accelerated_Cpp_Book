# Exercise 1-2

Are the following definitions valid? Why or why not?

`const std::string exclam = "!";`

`const std::string message = "Hello" + ", world" + exclam;`

## Solution
The first definition is valid.

The second definition is NOT valid. According to the book, we cannot concatenate two string literals.
