# Exercise 0-6

## Problem
Is this a valid program? Why or why not?
```Cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {{{{{{ std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl; }}}}}}
```
## Solution
Yes. This is a valid program.

While ommiting the `return 0;` statement is allowed in the `main` function, it is good programming practice to include it.
