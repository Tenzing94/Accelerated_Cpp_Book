# Exercise 0-8

## Problem
...and this one?
```Cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    // This is a comment that extends over several lines
    // by using // at the beginning of each line instead of using /*
    // or */ to delimit comments.
       std::cout << "Does this work?" << std::endl;
       return 0;
}
```

## Solution
Yes. This is a valid program.

The `/*` and the `*/` that you see are part of the comment itself.
