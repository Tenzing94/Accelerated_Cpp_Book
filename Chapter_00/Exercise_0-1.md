# Exercise 0-1

## Problem
What does the following statement do?  
`3 + 4;`

## Solution
`3 + 4;` is an expression that yields `7` as its result, and has no side effects.

According to the book (pg. 6): _An expression followed by a semicolon is a statement, called an **expression statement**, which is a request to execute the expression for its side effects and discard its result. The expression is optional; omitting its results in a **null statement**, which has no effect._
