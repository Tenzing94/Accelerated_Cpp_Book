# Exercise 3-5

## Problem
Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once. The program could keep two `vector`s in sync: The first should hold the student’s names, and the second the final grades that can be computed as input is read. For now, you should assume a fixed number of homework grades. We’ll see in [4.1.3/56] how to handle a variable number of grades intermixed with student names.

## Solution

### Code
```Cpp
// code
```
